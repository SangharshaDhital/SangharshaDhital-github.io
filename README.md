## About Me
Hi there! I'm a Full Stack Java Developer with over 8 years of experience. I love building cool stuff with technology!

## What I Do
### Building Websites and Apps
- **Back-End Skills:** I make the parts of websites you don't see, using tools like Servlets, JSP, Struts, Hibernate, and Spring.
- **Front-End Skills:** I design the parts you do see, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.

### Making Things Secure
I'm all about keeping your info safe online. I use special methods to make sure your data stays private and secure.

### Putting Stuff Online
Once everything is ready, I put it all online! I use platforms like Tomcat, WebLogic, and AWS to make sure everything runs smoothly.

## More About Me
I'm not just a tech person! I'm also interested in lots of other stuff like nature, physics, philosophy, and music. I believe all these interests help me think creatively and solve problems better.
